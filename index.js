// â€œImagine you need to process 100 items with an asynchronous function, where each item is independent.
//  The catch: you can only run 10 async calls in parallel.
//  Once those 10 finish, you trigger the next batch of 10, and repeat the cycle until all 100 items are processed."

// How would you implement this in JavaScript?
