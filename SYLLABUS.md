After mastering operators, the next logical topics to explore in JavaScript are:

1. **Control Flow and Loops**:
   - **Conditionals**: Deep dive into `if`, `else`, `switch`, and ternary operators.
   - **Loops**: Study `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and `for...of`/`for...in` loops. Understand when and how to use each.

2. **Functions**:
   - **Function Declarations and Expressions**: Learn about function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
   - **Closures**: Understand how closures work and their applications.
   - **Higher-Order Functions**: Explore functions that accept other functions as arguments or return functions.

3. **Scope and Context**:
   - **Scope**: Differentiate between global and local scope, and understand lexical scoping.
   - **Context**: Study `this`, its behavior in different scenarios, and how `bind`, `call`, and `apply` modify it.

4. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - **Callbacks**: Learn about using callbacks for handling asynchronous operations.
   - **Promises**: Understand how to work with promises and `Promise.all`/`Promise.race`.
   - **Async/Await**: Study the `async` and `await` keywords for more readable asynchronous code.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - **Try/Catch**: Learn how to handle errors gracefully using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw`.

6. **Objects and Arrays**:
   - **Objects**: Study object creation, manipulation, and methods. Understand prototypes and inheritance.
   - **Arrays**: Learn about array methods, destructuring, and array manipulation techniques.

7. **ES6+ Features**:
   - **Destructuring**: Learn how to destructure arrays and objects.
   - **Spread and Rest Operators**: Understand how to use `...` for spreading and gathering elements.
   - **Modules**: Study how to use `import` and `export` for modular code.

8. **Prototypes and Inheritance**:
   - **Prototype Chain**: Understand how inheritance works in JavaScript through prototypes.
   - **Class Syntax**: Learn about ES6 class syntax for object-oriented programming.

9. **Memory Management**:
   - **Garbage Collection**: Understand how JavaScript manages memory and how to avoid memory leaks.

10. **DOM Manipulation and Events**:
    - **DOM**: Learn how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and understand DOM events.
    - **Event Handling**: Study event listeners, event delegation, and event propagation.

11. **Performance Optimization**:
    - **Profiling**: Learn how to profile and optimize JavaScript code for better performance.
    - **Debouncing and Throttling**: Study techniques to improve performance in event handling.

12. **Testing**:
    - **Unit Testing**: Explore testing frameworks and tools like Jest or Mocha for writing unit tests.
    - **Integration Testing**: Understand how to test interactions between components or modules.
